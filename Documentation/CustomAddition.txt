Our custom addition that was approved is adding background music and sound effects that are triggered
by certain user or ai interactions. We found mp3 music files that fit the theme of our project. The events that 
triggered sound effects were things such as ai or user selecting a place on the board and it being a miss or hit. 
We also had sound effects for clicking buttons that helped the user place his ships.
