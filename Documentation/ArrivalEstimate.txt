#Time Accounting

We arrived at our time esitmate to complete the project by having everyone read the code base that was inherited 
and figuring all the requirements for project 2. Once, we did this we were able to identify the difficulty of 
completing this project. We arose to the conclusion that it should take us between 20 to 25 hours to complete the project.
Why? Well, we noticed that the codebase inherited was very tricky to understand and that it wasn't built in a way so that it could
easily modified. We also weren't very experienced with using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS so before we could begin 
any implementation reading javaScript documentation was needed. We heavily used pair programming so it may take longer to code something but it's
easier to find bugs among the people working on it. Lastly, our time estimate came from the fact that we weren't quite 
sure how to split up the project so it hard to determine how many hours each person would need to work on this project.
